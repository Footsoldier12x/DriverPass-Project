# DriverPass-Project

    # Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
    	Our client DriverPass wants to train students for their driving test at their local Department of motor vehicles (DMV).
    	More specifically, they intend to fulfill the need for better student driver training with online and in-person classes and on-the-road training with a driver.
    	This will increase the rate at which students pass their tests at the DMV with an easy-to-use system.


    # What did you do particularly well?
    	Keeping in the description of the client in mind at every step of the planning process.
        
    # If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    	The level of detail of some of my diagrams are not up to par with industry standards. 
        For example, the log in activity diagram does not show email confirmation or two factor authentication.
    
    # How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    	The program must fulfill the user's needs and involving them as much as possible will alleviate having to rework a feature because of miscommunication. 
 
    # How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
    	As a student filling in for many roles throughout the development process, I have noticed that it is critical to accurately communicate the purpose of the project being designed or implemented. Even though there are many frameworks available to guide the development process, most of them rest on a solid communication foundation. My strategy for analyzing or design any system would revolve around clear and open communication.
